### Maytrmeesh (Graduation project)

### Date created
27/7/2021

### Description
A lot of people don’t care about the large amount of
food that is thrown in dumpsters daily where someone can
make use of it instead. We believe that the application can
change that and reduce food waste by giving it away either
for free for the less fortunate and the ones who cannot
afford to buy their own food or whoever interested in food
promotions and offers. Restaurants, bakeries, and other
stores that serves fresh food will be included in these
services.

### Technologies used
- Python
- Vagrant
- Django and Django-rest-framework
- Content based recommendation system (With Cosine similarity)

### System purpose
- Reducing food waste.
- Notifying near customers by the offers and promotions.
- Customers can reserve freshly-made budget meals using
the application and saving it before it’s dumped.
- Customers can donate meals to the less fortunate as a
charity service
- Business owners are benefited from the system as their
revenue increases and on the other hand food waste is
reduced significantly
